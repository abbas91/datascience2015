    "Resampling statistics refers to the use of the observed data or of a data generating mechanism (such as a die) to produce new hypothetical samples (resamples) that mimic the underlying population, the results of which can then be analyzed. With numerous cross-disciplinary applications especially in the sub-disciplines of the life science, resampling methods are widely used since they are options when parametric approaches are difficult to employ or otherwise do not apply.  \n",

    "Resampled data is derived using a manual mechanism to simulate many pseudo-trials. These approaches were difficult to utilize prior to 1980s since these methods require many repetitions. With the incorporation of computers, the trials can be simulated in a few minutes and is why these methods have become widely used.  The methods that will be discussed are used to make many statistical inferences about the underlying population. The most practical use of resampling methods is to derive confidence intervals and test hypotheses. This is accomplished by drawing simulated samples from the data themselves (resamples) or from a reference distribution based on the data; afterwards, you are able to observe how the statistic of interest in these resamples behaves. Resampling approaches can be used to substitute for traditional statistical (formulaic) approaches or when a traditional approach is difficult to apply. These methods are widely used because their ease of use. They generally require minimal mathematical formulas, needing a small amount of mathematical (algebraic) knowledge. These methods are easy to understand and stray away from choosing an incorrect formula in your diagnostics.\n",

    "1.Estimating the precision of sample statistics (medians, variances, percentiles) by using subsets of available data (jackknifing) or drawing randomly with replacement from a set of data points (bootstrapping)\n",

    "his is a method that derives data from a mechanism (such as a proportion) that models the process you wish to understand (the population). This produces new samples of simulated data, which can be examined as possible results. After doing many repetitions, Monte Carlo tests produce exact p-values that can be interpreted as an error rate; letting the number of repeats sharpens the critical region.\n"

    "This is a type of statistical significance test, in which a reference distribution is obtained by calculating all possible values of the test statistic under rearrangements of the labels on the observed data points. Like other the Bootstrap and the Monte Carlo approach, permutation methods for significance testing also produce exact p-values. These tests are the oldest, simplest, and most common form of resampling tests and are suitable whenever the null hypothesis makes all permutations of the observed data equally likely. In this method, data is reassigned randomly without replacement. They are usually based off the Student t and Fisher’s F test. Most non-parametric tests are based on permutations of rank orderings of the data. This method has become practical because of computers; without them, it may be impossible to derive all the possible permutations. This method should be employed when you are dealing with an unknown distribution.\n"

    "This approach is based on the fact that all we know about the underlying population is what we derived in our samples. Becoming the most widely used resampling method, it estimates the sampling distribution of an estimator by sampling with replacement from the original estimate, most often with the purpose of deriving robust estimates of standard errors and confidence intervals of a population parameter. Like all Monte Carlo based methods, this approach can be used to define confidence Intervals and in hypothesis testing. This method is beneficial to side step problems with non-normality or if the distribution parameters are unknown. This method can be used to calculate an appropriate sample size for experimental design.\n"

    "This method is used in statistical inference to estimate the bias and standard error in a statistic, when a random sample of observations is used to calculate it. This method provides a systematic method of resampling with a mild amount of calculations. It offers “improved” estimate of the sample parameter to create less sampling bias. The basic idea behind the jackknife estimator lies in systematically re-computing the statistic estimate leaving out one observation at a time from the sample set. From this new “improved\" sample statistic can be used to estimate the bias can be variance of the statistic."
